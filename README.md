# Super Mario 64 Port

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J), (U), (E), and (SH).
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures are in progress.
- Beyond Nintendo 64, it can also target the PS Vita.

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the game.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the assets.

## Building for the Vita
Savedata is stored at `ux0:data/sm64_save_file.bin`. `cont.m64` can be put either into the same folder, or into `ux0:app/PCSE64001/` for TAS input.

### Prerequisites
For running this on the PS Vita you will first need to extract the runtime shader compiler. Follow this [guide](https://samilops2.gitbook.io/vita-troubleshooting-guide/shader-compiler/extract-libshacccg.suprx) for help with that.

- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install -y git build-essential pkg-config`.
- Windows (x86_64): `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`

### Build Instructions
1. Install [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org)
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/martepato/sm64-vita.git`, which will create a directory `sm64-vita` and then **enter** it `cd sm64-vita`.
3. Place a Super Mario 64 ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the repository's root directory for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
4. Building
    1. Run `./build_deps.sh` to build and install dependencies. This only has to be done once.
    2. Run `make TARGET_VITA=1 vpk` to build the game. Add `-j4` to improve build time.
5. The installable vpk will be located at `build/us_vita/sm64.<VERSION>.vpk`

## Known Issues

1. TAS Input stops working if the app is suspended or the Vita is put to sleep.
